phase_5:
what is type of the input?
How long is the string?

phase_6:
what is the type of the input?
There is a call to read_six_numbers. This gives us a clue that the type is int and there would be 6 numbers. Going through read_siz_numbers at inst 401480 a memory address is moved to esi. This address 0x4025c3 has %d %d %d %d %d %d format string, indicating that this is the 2nd arg to the  sscanf function. sscanf's 2nd argument goes in the rsi function, which is why rsi copy's that address.

Where are my input numbers saved?
1st input is saved at address 0x7fffffffde00. Inst 40111e compares 1st number with 5. If no is aabove 5, bomb explodes.40111e
2nd input is saved at address 0x7fffffffde04. Inst 401138 copies input 2 from that address into eax. 4013b compares inputs 1 and 2. If they are equal explode bomb.
3rd input is saved at address 0x7fffffffde08.....
Instructions until 40114b check that the 1st input is less than 5 and that the rest
